# Covid Vaccine Management System  

## Overview  
This program implements a linked list to manage Covid-19 vaccination records. It stores applicant information, including their vaccine history, and provides operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal of records.  

## Requirements  
- Java 8 or higher  
- IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE  

## Installation Instructions  
1. Download all source files:  
   - `CovidVaccine.java`  
   - `Vaccine.java`  
   - `Node.java`  
   - `LinkedList.java`  
   - `TutorialFifthMain.java`  
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.  
3. Compile and run `TutorialFifthMain.java`.  

## Usage  
- The program starts by inserting 10 predefined applicants into a linked list.  
- It randomly deletes two applicants.  
- The remaining applicants are displayed.  
- The program then deletes all applicants and confirms the list is empty.  

To run the program, execute:  
```bash
javac *.java
java TutorialFifthMain
```
